Google interprets emails such as john.doe@gmail.com interchangeably with j.o.hn.doe@gmail.com or johndoe@gmail.com, on <L href='https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7436150?hl=en'>purpose</L>. The presence or absence of dots doesn't affect how Google handles these addresses, they're all considered the same. This means, if you discover an online service that simply stores these emails as-is,  when registering new users, you could exploit it indefinitely. You can repeatedly register using variations of the same email, and it will work every time. The service would treat each registration as unique unless it specifically accounts for the dot placement. In other words they're cooked.
