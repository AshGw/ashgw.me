*Guide for the impatient*
</C>
<H2>Only Using SSH To Sign Commits</H2>
<C>First generate an SSH key, you must have ``ssh`` installed, to verify, run this</C>
<Code
  code={`ssh -V
`}
  language="shell"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>
You should get the version info, with no errors.
</C>
<C>
To generate keys for GitHub specifically, here I'll save you some time, paste <L href="https://github.com/AshGw/dotfiles/blob/main/.ssh/_gh_gen.sh">this</L> in your terminal.
</C>
<C>
This will will generate an SSH key pair, `ashgw` is my username, yours will be different.
</C>
<Code
  code={`Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Created directory '/home/ashgw/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):`}
  language="shell"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>
Optionally enter a key phrase, that's on you.
</C>
<Code
  code={`Your identification has been saved in /home/ashgw/.ssh/github
Your public key has been saved in /home/ashgw/.ssh/github.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:A7vCUer8pc+IPmTOHS5ULS4hOXX4SElUA0lbVj9SbgI ashgw@ashx
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|   +=*E.. .      |
|    *+.o +       |
|   +.+o.o =      |
|  + oo+o.+ .     |
|   oo+..S        |
|   +=.o. .       |

➜  ~`}
  language="shell"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>
You should get the same output with no problems.
Now if you run the command, while  <L href="https://github.com/astrand/xclip">`xclip`</L>  is installed, the public key will be copied to your clipboard, if you don't have `xclip`, then manually copy it.
</C>
<Code
  code={`cat ~/.ssh/github.pub`}
  language="shell"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>You should get the public key</C>
<Code
  code={`➜  ~ cat ~/.ssh/github.pub
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIMoih/l+dazF/waAOFry1h0i5kT4+cislDxfFRreE2I2 ashgw@ashx
➜  ~   `}
  language="shell"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<H2>Where To Paste It?</H2>
<C>
Go <L href='https://github.com/settings/keys'>here</L>, Under SSH keys section, you'll find an "authentication keys" section as well as "signing key" section, paste your public key in **BOTH**.  Before that works though, you need to modify your ``~/.gitconfig``
</C>
<Code
  code={`[user]
    email = <YOUR_ACTUAL_VERIFIED_EMAIL_ON_GITHUB>
    name = <YOUR_NAME_CAN_BE_FAKE_THO>
	signingkey = /home/<YOUR_USERNAME_HERE>/.ssh/github.pub

# other stuff ...`}
  language="shell"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>
That's it. If you're wondering what else can be put inside ``~/.gitconfig``   you can checkout mine <L href='https://github.com/AshGw/dotfiles/blob/main/.gitconfig'>here</L>. Now your commits will be verified.
</C>
<H2>Connect With SSH, Sign With GPG</H2>
<C>
Do the steps above, then try to clone one of your repo's with `SSH`, if not problem occurs, you're good. Next, you must have `gpg` installed. You're probably on ``Debian``, here's how to cop it.
</C>
<Code
  code={`sudo apt update && install gnupg`}
  language="shell"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>

<C>
Verify with: 
</C>

<Code
  code={`gpg -version `}
  language="shell"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>

<C>
Second, if you don't have a key laying around, generate a new one with: 
</C>

<Code
  code={`gpg --full-generate-key`}
  language="shell"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>

<C>
If you've successfully generated your key, then if you list your keys with 
</C>

<Code
  code={`➜  ~ gpg -k `}
  language="shell"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>

<C>
You should get something like this
</C>

<Code
  code={`➜  ~ gpg -k
/home/ashgw/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
------------------------------
pub   rsa4096 2018-02-20 [SC]
      79821E0224D34EC4969FF6A8E5168EE090AE80D0
uid           [ultimate] Ashref Gwader (personal) <ashrefgw@proton.me>
sub   rsa4096 2018-02-20 [E]

➜  ~`}
  language="shell"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>

<C>
You see that large number? That's your key ID. Copy it and paste it in your ``~/.gitconfig``  file 
</C>

<Code
  code={`[user]
    email = <SAME_AS_ABOVE>
    name = <SAME_AS_ABOVE>
    signingkey =  <THAT_ID>
[gpg] # mandatory 
    program = gpg

[commit] # mandatory 
    gpgsign = true

# other stuff...`}
  language="shell"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>

<C>
Next thing you need to export your public GPG key.
</C>



<Code
  code={`gpg --armor --export <THAT_KEY_ID> | xclip -selection clipboard`}
  language="shell"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>


<C>
If you have `xclip` installed you'll get it copied to your clipboard, else, just run this
</C>

<Code
  code={`gpg --armor --export <THAT_KEY_ID> `}
  language="shell"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>

<C>
You'll get your public key ID, it should start with
</C>
<Code
  code={`-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`}
  language="shell"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>
It's a long chain of characters, you can find mine <L href="https://github.com/ashgw.gpg">here</L>, yours will be there too if you use it to sign commits, at  `https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>.gpg`.

Next, take the key you just copied and paste it <L href='https://github.com/settings/gpg/new'>here</L>, give the key a title so you don't forget it and paste the public key.
That's it, your commits are now verified with your ``GPG`` key, while you're still able to use ``SSH`` with GitHub. You can follow the same steps for other platforms.
