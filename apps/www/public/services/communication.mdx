When we first meet, we'll talk on Zoom or Google Meet. For messages we can use Slack, Discord or emails. We'll discuss what you want, and need, and then weâ€™ll move forward from there. After we've sealed an agreement, we'll will **not** use any of these communication channels anymore (unless absolutely necessary).

Simply because these  channels can be challenging to track effectively and often lead to information leakage. Conversations may span across multiple platforms and become fragmented, making it difficult to keep a record of discussions and decisions made throughout the project lifecycle.

Instead, all communication is centralized through the <L href="/services/glossary#ticket-system">ticket system,</L> where each communication thread is tied to a specific subject or <L href="/services/glossary#tasks">task</L> related to the project. This ensures that discussions remain focused and relevant, and making it easier to track progress on individual tasks or topics.

Aside from the traceability provided by the ticket system, <L href="/services/transparency">transparency</L> is crucial. It grants you real-time visibility into project updates, milestones, and potential roadblocks, where you can actively monitor the project's progression from initiation to completion, which helps to build trust and confidence among all parties involved.

This way, we ensure that all interactions adhere to established guidelines and protocols. This helps mitigate the risk of misunderstandings, conflicts, or misinterpretations, especially as the project expands in complexity or involves multiple stakeholders.
