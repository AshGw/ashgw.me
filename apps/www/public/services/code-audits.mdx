<H2>Why You Need One ?</H2>

I wrote an <L href="/blog/independent-code-audit">article</L> about why your software needs independent code audits.

In short, I talked about how independent audits can help mitigate issues stemming from a lack of oversight within internal teams (for many <L href="/blog/tag/skill-issues">reasons</L>). 
Without vigilant scrutiny of <L href="/blog/tag/quality">quality</L> and architectural integrity, problems can escalate unnoticed, hindering future development, which leads to project failures and loss of money.

I only audit for projects that use my <L href="/about">stack.</L>

A code audit provide clarity on a project's status. It offers a concise one-page review covering crucial aspects such as suitability for future modifications, flexibility in team adjustments, and code quality assessment. Also, it aids in uncovering as many <L href='/services/glossary#tickets'>bugs</L> as possible. All within a fixed one-day service.
