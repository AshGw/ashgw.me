<H2>The Rule Software Can’t Ignore</H2>

<C>
Humanity's progress hinges on one thing: the ability to **preserve knowledge.** Thousands of years ago, we were just like any other species, learning through direct experience and passing it down verbally. Your father taught you to hunt, your mother taught you to forage, and you passed that knowledge to your children. But what happened if you died too soon? Or if the knowledge wasn’t passed on clearly? It was **lost forever**, forcing the next generation to rediscover everything from scratch.
</C>

<C>
The invention of writing changed everything. For the first time, knowledge could outlive individuals, communities, and even civilizations. Writing made us efficient, scalable, and resilient. Without it, we’d still be stuck in the Stone Age. That same principle applies to modern software development: **if your knowledge isn’t documented, it might as well not exist.**
</C>

<C>
Every undocumented meeting, call, or decision is like the burning of the Library of Alexandria. Knowledge is lost, leaving your project weaker and more dependent on oral tradition. And oral tradition in software? It’s a death sentence for scalability, clarity, and long-term success.
</C>

<H2>The Problem with Lost Knowledge</H2>

<C>
Think about how software projects are run today. Teams rely on constant meetings, quick calls, and Slack messages to "communicate." But what happens when the people involved in those conversations leave? What happens when new developers join and have to piece together the context themselves? The knowledge is gone.
</C>

<C>
Or worse, it’s trapped in someone’s head. Knowledge hoarders, whether intentional or not, become bottlenecks. If they’re sick, busy, or quit, the entire project grinds to a halt. This isn’t just inefficient; it’s irresponsible. Knowledge in software **must be conserved**, and the only way to do that is through documentation.
</C>

<H2>Why Documentation Beats Communication</H2>

<C>
Communication is fleeting. It relies on people being available, attentive, and cooperative at all times. Documentation, on the other hand, is permanent. It’s the written record of your system, your decisions, and your solutions. It doesn’t depend on memory, context, or the availability of specific individuals.
</C>

<C>
When your project is well-documented, anyone can step in, understand the system, and contribute without needing endless meetings or hand-holding. Documentation isn’t just about saving time, it’s about ensuring that your project **isn’t fragile.**
</C>

<C>
Here’s the reality: no matter how good your team is, people leave. Platforms change. Requirements evolve. If you’re not documenting your work, you’re gambling with your project’s future.
</C>

<H2>Calls Are Not Documentation</H2>

<C>
I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve heard, "Let’s hop on a quick call." And every time I hear it, I cringe. Calls are fine for brainstorming or emergencies, but they’re no substitute for documentation. Here’s why:
</C>

- <C>Calls don’t scale. The knowledge shared in a call is only accessible to the people who were there. Everyone else? Out of luck.</C>
    
- <C>Calls create dependency. If you have to explain something in a call, it means the information isn’t documented. That means the same question will come up again and again, wasting everyone’s time.</C>
    
- <C>Calls destroy continuity. Knowledge shared in a call often disappears the moment the call ends. Unless someone takes thorough notes (and let’s be honest, they rarely do), the information is effectively lost.</C>

<C>
Instead of jumping on calls, solve the root problem. If something is unclear in the codebase, document it. If someone finds a bug in an open-source library, write about it on Stack Overflow or GitHub. If there’s missing context in the documentation, **fix the documentation.**
</C>

<H2>The Goal: Autonomous Software Projects</H2>

<C>
The ultimate goal of any software project should be autonomy. A well-documented project doesn’t need constant explanations, meetings, or context-switching. It runs itself. Developers should be able to:
</C>

- <C>Join the project.</C>
- <C>Read the documentation.</C>
- <C>Start contributing.</C>

<C>
If your project can’t meet this standard, you’re doing it wrong. No one should have to ask endless questions or attend dozens of calls just to get started. The information they need should already be written down.
</C>

<C>
And no, this doesn’t mean you can skip requirements. If you want clear documentation, you first need clear requirements. Know what you want, define it explicitly, and document it. Vague expectations lead to vague code, and vague code leads to chaos.
</C>

<H2>The Responsibility of Engineers</H2>

<C>
As engineers, our job isn’t just to write code. It’s to build systems that last. That means writing code that’s clear, maintainable, and self-explanatory. But it also means documenting the decisions behind that code. Why did we build it this way? What problem does it solve? How should it evolve in the future?
</C>

<C>
This isn’t just a nice-to-have. It’s a core responsibility. Without documentation, your code is just a black box. New developers won’t understand it, bugs will multiply, and the system will eventually collapse under its own weight.
</C>

<C>
And let’s be clear: documentation isn’t just for your team. It’s for the future. If you contribute to open-source libraries, document your work so others can learn from it. If you fix a tricky bug, share your solution so others don’t waste time solving the same problem. Documentation isn’t just about your project, it’s about the broader ecosystem.
</C>

<H2>Final Thoughts</H2>

<C>
The act of documenting isn’t just a chore, it’s a commitment to quality. It’s about ensuring that your work outlasts you, your team, and even your company. Every undocumented decision is a risk. Every undocumented process is a liability. And every undocumented call is a lost opportunity.
</C>

<C>
So, stop treating documentation like an afterthought. It’s not just a part of software development, it’s the foundation. Write it down. Preserve the knowledge. Make your project future-proof. Because at the end of the day, communication fades, but documentation lasts forever.
