<C>
The purpose of writing tests is to uncover as many bugs as possible by actively seeking to **break** the code. Merely verifying that the software performs expected tasks, is insufficient. Yes you should  test and confirm that the software operates as intended in a perfect utopian scenario, but only thinking about tests this way is highly myopic, it's only a matter of time before it breaks at the hands of **users**, **instead** of your development team.

 A failing tests is not a test that errors out and runs red. A failing test is a test that failed at doing it's job which is detecting bugs, it ran green this time, it didn't find any errors, it failed.
