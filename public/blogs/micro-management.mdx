Managers might struggle to relinquish tasks they're comfortable with or fear mistakes due to high standards. However, the long-term effects of micromanagement are detrimental, leaning to stress, burnout, and reduced confidence in leadership among subordinates. It undermines a manager's role  and hinders teams from reaching their full potential.

How do you know you're a micromanager? You're probably having 
difficulty keeping your team [motivated](), delegating [tasks](), fixation on small details, or the desire to be consulted on every little decision.

<H2>Symptoms</H2>
<C>
As a good manager, you should establish **clear** quality **standards**, define *roles*, **responsibilities** and **expectations**, and outline the **rewards** for success and consequences for failure. A good manager doesn't need to micromanage people, instead, they periodically lay down **firm** guidelines: deliver results and be **rewarded**, fail to meet expectations and face **consequences**, it's a straightforward principle that has stood the test of time.
