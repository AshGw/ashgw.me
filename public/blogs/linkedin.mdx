LinkedIn, the so-called "professional networking platform," is a dumpster fire of NPC cringe behavior. If you’ve ever scrolled through it, you know what I mean. It’s the endless parade of self-congratulatory posts, corporate humblebrags, and outright nonsense. The place where everyone is a CEO, "crushing it," and the line between real achievement and performative nonsense is so blurred it might as well not exist.

When I say LinkedIn is cringe, I’m not throwing shade for no reason. It’s a breeding ground for inauthenticity. It’s like a bad reality TV show, where everyone’s competing to outdo each other in a race to the bottom. Whether it’s the recycled "thought leadership," faux-inspirational posts that scream desperation, or straight-up brainrot, the platform has turned into a facade. It’s not about genuine connection or meaningful interaction like it's supposed to be, it’s about projecting an image. A fake, overly polished image.

That’s not to say everyone on LinkedIn is fake. There are genuinely cool people doing amazing things. Communities of bright minds exchanging real value? That’s rare but worth respecting. Problem is, those gems are buried under an unbearable mountain of cringe. The platform itself encourages this behavior, pushing everyone to polish their persona to absurd levels. It’s exhausting.

I used to have a LinkedIn account. I connected with people, interacted, and even posted. But over time, I realized that out of hundreds of connections, I only talked to maybe five. The rest was noise. LinkedIn isn’t about meaningful networking, it’s about climbing the corporate ladder. And let’s be honest, it showcases the worst aspects of corporate culture: relentless self-promotion, superficiality, and constant pressure to be something you’re not.

One of the weirdest things about LinkedIn is the mix of corporate-speak and personal branding. People turn the most mundane moments into life-altering lessons. "Today, I spilled my coffee, here’s what it taught me about B2B sales..." Seriously, GET A GRIP.

And the videos? Don’t get me started. Everyone wants to be Gary Vee, dropping "knowledge bombs" from their car with shaky cameras and zero substance. The cringe is unbearable.

Then there’s the relentless positivity. LinkedIn has this unspoken rule that criticism is taboo. Everything must be wrapped in fake smiles and corporate buzzwords. The result? A feed so saccharine it’ll rot your teeth. Even emojis are more authentic than most of the garbage posted there.

But the real kicker? The "I just got fired" posts. Imagine being laid off and turning it into a motivational saga. "I’m so grateful for the opportunity to grow." Dude, you just got screwed by your employer cutting costs. Stop praising the people who tossed you out like yesterday’s trash.

And let’s talk about DMs. The unsolicited pitches are unbearable. People you’ve never met slide into your inbox with robotic messages about services you don’t need or jobs you don’t want. Can you not?

The sad truth is LinkedIn dominates the professional networking space. If you want to find a job, build a network, or stay in the loop, you’re stuck with it. It’s the only game in town. Most of us are there out of necessity, not choice. It’s a game of compliance, and the moment you step off the hamster wheel, you’re out of the loop.

LinkedIn is a mirror for everything wrong with corporate culture. It’s fake, exhausting, and soul-sucking. I refuse to play the game. I won’t fake positivity or polish my personality to fit in. I’m not an NPC, and I’m not about to start acting like one. So yeah, you can’t find me on LinkedIn. And I’m good with that.
