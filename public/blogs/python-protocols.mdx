<H2>Intro</H2>
<C>
    The concept of protocols provides a  way to check type compatibility,
     one that diverges from the conventional class hierarchy approach. 
In the world of Rust, you might be familiar with traits. They share the same essence as Python protocols, focusing on behavior rather than lineage.
 TypeScript interfaces offer a similar structural approach.
</C>
<H2>Structural Subtyping</H2>
<C>
Traditional type systems rely on the relationship between classes, 
often determined by inheritance. Python, however, <L href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0544/">PEP 544</L>
 introduces
 the notion of structural subtyping or static duck typing.
  We often say if an object looks like a duck, swims like a duck, 
  and quacks like a duck; well, it's considered a duck,
 or in this case, it adheres to a particular duck protocol .
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`from typing import Protocol

class OrganicOrganism(Protocol):

    def grows(self) -> None: ...

    def reproduces(self) -> None: ...

    def responds_to_stimuli(self) -> None: ...

    def adapts(self) -> None: ...


class Human:

    def grows(self) -> None: pass

    def reproduces(self) -> None: pass

    def responds_to_stimuli(self) -> None: pass

    def adapts(self) -> None: pass

    def conscious(self) -> None: pass


H: OrganicOrganism = Human()
O: Human = OrganicOrganism() 
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={true}

/>
<C>Type checking this with ``MyPy`` shows complaints  </C>
<Code
  code=
{`(.venv) ➜ mypy main.py 
main.py:26: error: Cannot instantiate protocol class "OrganicOrganism"  [misc]
main.py:26: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "OrganicOrganism", variable has type "Human")  [assignment]
Found 2 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
`}
language="bash"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>

<C>
But when you fix it with 
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`H: OrganicOrganism = Human()
# O: Human = OrganicOrganism() 
# no every organism is conscious
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>
You get 
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`(.venv) ➜ mypy main.py 
Success: no issues found in 1 source file
`}
language="bash"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>

<C>
Every human behaves like an organism in some way, 
but an organism may not behave like a human
<S3/>
How about a plant 
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`class Plant:
    def grows(self) -> None: pass

    def reproduces(self) -> None: pass

    def responds_to_stimuli(self) -> None: pass

    def adapts(self) -> None: pass

P: OrganicOrganism = Plant() #Ok
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>

<C>
  Even though `Human` and `Plant` don't share a common ancestor,
   they both conform to the `OrganicOrganism` protocol because they exhibit
    the required methods. No need for inheritance here 
</C>
<H3>Ok we know all that, what's special</H3>
<C>
Now, let's explore a practical use case. Imagine a case where you have different classes representing different Request objects or responses
 maybe from different libraries, and you're 
 trying to create a common class (adapter) that
  groups all these different objects and their
   methods in one , you might expect these
    classes to inherit from a common base class. 
However, with protocols, you can define a protocol 
representing the expected Response object behavior
 with abstracted behavior, allowing disparate classes
  to adhere to the same structure without a shared ancestry.
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`import typing
from typing import Optional, Dict, Protocol, runtime_checkable


@runtime_checkable
class RequestProtocol(Protocol):
    def get_cookie(self, cookie_name: str) -> Optional[str]:
        ...
    @property
    def all_cookies(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
        ...
    @property
    def is_connection_secure(self) -> bool:
        ...

    @property
    def get_base_url(self) -> str:
        ...
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={false}

/>
<C>
You can extend these different Request objects to where they adhere to the protocol 
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`from libx import Request

class RequestX(Request):
    def get_cookie(self, cookie_name: str) -> Optional[str]:
        return self.cookies.get(cookie_name)

    @property
    def all_cookies(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
        return self.cookies

    @property
    def is_connection_secure(self) -> bool:
        return self.url.is_secure

    @property
    def get_base_url(self) -> str:
        return str(self.base_url)
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={false}

/>
<S3/>
<Code
  code={`from liby import Request

class RequestY(Request):
    def get_cookie(self, cookie_name: str) -> Optional[str]:
        return self.cookie(cookie_name)

    @property
    def all_cookies(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
        return self.cookies

    @property
    def is_connection_secure(self) -> bool:
        return self.is_https

    @property
    def get_base_url(self) -> str:
        return self.base_url
`}
  language="python"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>

<C>As you can see these different libraries/frameworks
 have different implementation over how they access 
 different request attributes/methods, but with a protocol 
 you can define a unified way hat all these different objects 
 adhere to, now for example if you want to create a function 
 that processes a given request you can annotate the request 
 parameter with ``RequestProtocol``, this means that his function
  will process any class that adheres to this protocol</C>
<Code
  code={`def process_request(req: RequestProtocol) -> None:

    # do some anything with the shared methods/attributes
    process_request(req=RequestX(...)) # OK, no type issues 
    process_request(req=RequestX(...)) # OK, no type issues
`}
  language="python"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>Another use case is using `Protocol` to type function signatures
check this out</C>
<Code
  code={`class Foo:
    ...

@runtime_checkable
class Bar(Protocol):
    async def __call__(self, foo: Foo) -> None:
        ...
`}
  language="python"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>

<C>Any function that is asynchronous, accepts an argument called `foo` of 
type  `Foo` and returns nothing , adheres to this protocol, a given function might be</C>
<Code
  code={`async def bar(foo: Foo): pass
`}
  language="python"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>If you would have typed this function otherwise it would have been</C>
<Code
  code={`f: Callable[[Foo],Awaitable[None]] = bar
`}
  language="python"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>It's much easier to type functions using `Protocol`
instead of </C>
<Code
  code={`def f(bar: Callable[[Foo],Awaitable[None]]) -> Any: ...
`}
  language="python"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>
If you annotate the protocol with `@runtime_checkable` protocol, you're allowed access to `isinstance()` and `issubclass()` functions to check the type at runtime
</C>
<Code
  code={`def f(bar: Bar) -> Any:
	if not isinstance(bar,Bar): ... # do something 
`}
  language="python"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>
And if you're trying to check the signature you can create a function that checks
 the signature of a given function if it adheres to the protocol or not, and provide helpful error messages why the given object does not adhere to the protocol
</C>
<Code
  code={`import inspect 

def check_signature(f: Bar) -> None:
    sig = inspect.signature(f)
    if not (
        "foo" in sig.parameters
        and sig.parameters["foo"].annotation == Foo
    ):
        raise TypeError(
            f"Given function does not adhere to Bar protocol: {f}"
        )
`}
  language="python"
  showLineNumbers={false}
/>
