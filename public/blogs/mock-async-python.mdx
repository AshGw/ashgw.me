<C>
The standard library does not really provide helpful practical information over the topic, nor does <L href="https://pytest.org">Pytest</L> docs, so I figured, I'll write a quick blog post on how to do it. There are third party libraries of course for this subject but I'm not a fan of using third parties, unless absolutely necessary, plus you should <L href="/blog/fundamentals">understand</L> how the subject works before abstracting it.
</C>

<C>
 I've <L href="/blog/async-python">previously</L> explained how the whole async concept works under the hood in Python. While not all the details are essential for this task, it's beneficial for grasping the nuances of asynchronous logic before attempting to test it.
 </C>

 <C>
With that out of the way, lets start with the two main ways you can patch an async object.
</C>

<H2>Monkey Patch</H2>

<C>
Given a function ``some_result`` of the class  ``Foo``  
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`class Foo:
    @staticmethod
    async def some_result(previous_status: bool) -> Result:
        return Result.OK if previous_status else Result.Err
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>

<C>
With this enumerable as a return type: 
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`import enum 

class Result(enum.Enum):
    Err = enum.auto()
    OK = enum.auto()
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={true}
/>

<C>
The goal is to mock the behavior of the `some_result()` method in the `Foo` class under different conditions. The method takes a ``boolean`` which is `previous_status` that we might not control, and returns a `Result`. Depending on the value of `previous_status`, the method should return either `OK` or `Err`. 
</C>

<C>
For this we'll need to <L href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch">monkey patch</L> it.
</C>

<Code
  code=
{`import pytest
from _pytest.monkeypatch import MonkeyPatch

@pytest.fixture
def mock_get_result(monkeypatch: MonkeyPatch) -> None:
    async def _always_ok(_previous_status: bool) -> Result: 
        return Result.OK
    monkeypatch.setattr(target=Foo, name="get_result", value=_always_ok)
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={true}
/>


<C>
Pytest allows us to define <L href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/explanation/fixtures.html">fixtures</L>, which are functions that set up or provide resources for our tests, so we don't keep repeating the logic again and again for each test case. In this case we only have one fixture.
</C>


<C>
`mock_foo_result_ok` monkey patches the  `some_result()` method of the `Foo` class. it replaces it with the inner function `_always_ok`, meaning 
when we pass this fixture as an argument to any test function whenever we use `some_result()` in that particular test, it comes patched already to always return whatever we want it to, in this case it is the `Ok` variant.
And by the way with Pytest, when dealing with asynchronous test cases, you have to mark them as ``@pytest.mark.asyncio`` and also install an async plugin, for me I'm using <L href="https://pytest-asyncio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">`pytest-asyncio`</L>. There are many others of course.
</C>


<Code
  code=
{`@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test(mock_get_result) -> None:
    r1 = await Foo.get_result(True) # either True or Flase 
    r2 = await Foo.get_result(False) # it does not matter

    assert r1 == Result.OK # passes 
    assert r2 == Result.OK # passes 
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>


<H2>AsyncMock Patch</H2>




<C>
Say I have a library called `playground` where the project structure is as follows (I use <L href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</L> btw)
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`(.venv) ➜  playground 
.
├── README.md
├── __init__.py
├── foo.py
├── poetry.lock
├── pyproject.toml
└── test.py
`}
language="bash"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>




<C>
The `foo`  module has a class that contains another class which has a method that uses <L href="https://www.python-httpx.org/">`httpx`</L> to request API data <L href="/blog/async-python">asynchronously</L>, this is a dummy example of course but you get the picture, we're trying to test the functionality of an object (function) that's two modules deep. 
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`import httpx

class Foo:
    class Bar:
        @staticmethod
        async def fetch(url: str) -> httpx.Response :
            async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
                response = await client.get(url)
                return response
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={true}
/>

<C>
How do you mock the ``fetch`` method ?
</C>


<C>
For this we will need `AsyncMock` (Python 3.8+), which is an enhanced version of the synchronous <L href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#the-mock-class">`Mock`</L> object, supporting async functions which returns <L href="/blog/async-python#related-objects">awaitables</L> instead of normal functions.  
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`from unittest.mock import AsyncMock
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>
We'll also need `patch()` to patch the object in hand.
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>


<C>
I'll be mocking the status code of  `httpx.Response` object along with the 
``JSON`` data that the `.json()` method returns.
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`import pytest

from unittest.mock import AsyncMock, patch
from playground.foo import Foo

FAKE_JSON = {'hey, this is some fake':'json'}

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test() -> None:
    with patch(
        "playground.foo.Foo.Bar.fetch"
    ) as patched_fetch:
        mock_object = AsyncMock()
        mock_object.status_code = 200
        mock_object.json = lambda:  FAKE_JSON

        patched_fetch.return_value = mock_object

        result = await Foo.Bar.fetch('https://api.example.com')
        assert result.status_code == 200
        assert result.json() == FAKE_JSON
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={true}
/>



<C>
Let's go step by step over what's happening here:
</C>
<C>
The `patch` function allows the use of <L href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#single-use-reusable-and-reentrant-context-managers">context managers,</L> so as long as you're in the context perse, whatever object you patched stays patched, you must provide the full import path of the function or else it will not work. So if you're patching a function from library ``X`` you might do:
</C>

<Code
  code=
{`@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test() -> None:
    with patch(
        "library_x.foo.class.method"
    ) as patched_method:
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>
With it, you can alter the return value of methods, hence the: 
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`patched_fetch.return_value = mock_object
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>
But what's the deal with the mock object?  the return value is  a mocked version of the response, it's saying: here I have a `Response` object that I'm trying to patch with a mocked version of it, that behaves like I need it to, we need a basic mock object that we can build upon, that's asynchronous in nature.
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`mock_object = AsyncMock()
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>
You can set any properties and any methods on this object as you see fit.
If you're setting properties you can directly set them as such: 
</C>
<Code
  code= 
{`mock_object.my_property = 'anything'
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>

<C>
But if it's a <L href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#annotating-callables">`Callable`</L> that you're mocking that's not exactly a `@property`, you must provide a function for it, you can use a lambda if the function is simple, or define a normal function and assign it, if it's complex.
In the example above I mocked the `.json()` method of the `Response` class with a lambda function that takes nothing and returns a dictionary holding the data I want to receive, which is `FAKE_JSON`.
Notice I didn't do the same for the `.status_code` as it is a property method so you can set it directly like you would set a normal attribute. 
</C>

<C>
With that out of the way, we can then test if it actually works.
</C>

<Code
  code= 
{`result = await Foo.Bar.fetch('https://api.fake-example.com')
assert result.status_code == 200
assert result.json() == {'patched':'json'}
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>
And it does!
</C>
<Code
  code=
