<C>
Without a solid foundation, your brain struggles to connect the dots. Concepts feel scattered, learning feels frustrating, and eventually, you burn out or give up.

Software development is problem-solving. It’s just like math. Before you tackle integrals or differential equations, you need to start with basic arithmetic. Assess where you’re at, build up from there. No shortcuts.
</C>

<C>
“How do I even start?” or “Where do I look?” Simple answer: you live in the internet era. Information is free, even  paid stuff, iykyk. Learn how to dig for knowledge. Stop expecting to be spoon-fed.

The gold rush wasn’t about finding gold, it was about selling shovels. Fast forward to the 21st century, and the modern shovel is selling dreams. Enter <L href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23167916/learn-to-code-tech-boot-camp-scams">bootcamps</L>, the masters of this game.
</C>

<C>
Stop falling for false promises. These bootcamps peddle unrealistic dreams to take your money. You wouldn’t believe a fitness coach promising six-pack abs in four weeks, so why trust a bootcamp promising you’ll become a “full-stack” developer in three months? 
</C>

<C>
Connecting some JavaScript CRUD APIs doesn’t make you a “full-stack” developer. Hell, no one is truly full-stack, being an expert in every area at once is a fantasy, especially after just three months. All you’ve done is memorize enough to cobble together yet another boring to-do app (at least make it original). Bootcamps overpromise, underdeliver, and leave you with disillusionment, frustration, and zero market-ready skills. Welcome to the sea of <L href="/blog/tag/skill-issues">mediocrity</L>.

<C>
Take a step back and assess your goals. Understand the time and effort required to achieve them. Don’t get blinded by flashy marketing or “get rich quick” pitches. Real success is earned, not bought.

<H2>Master Concepts, Not Tools</H2>

<C>
When you master fundamentals, you build a strong, adaptable foundation. New technologies become second nature because you understand the principles behind them. 
</C>

<C>
Sure, you can learn to drive in a few weeks and pass the test, but true mastery comes from understanding how the engine works, why gears shift, and what makes the car move. Same with programming: did you “learn” React, or did you just memorize how to use some APIs? Did you understand programming, or just pick up surface-level skills for one tool?
</C>

<C>
Before you use a tool, try building a basic version of it yourself. Want to use React? Build a rudimentary component system. Want to try an <L href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping">ORM</L>? Build one. Curious about web frameworks? Build one from scratch. Start with raw <L href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9293">TCP</L> connections and figure it out.
</C>

<C>
Tools are ephemeral. Today’s hot framework is tomorrow’s forgotten relic. If your “expertise” is tied to a tool, it disappears the moment that tool becomes obsolete. Congrats, you’ve wasted your time.
</C>

<C>
True engineering isn’t about memorizing APIs. It’s about understanding the “why” behind systems. That’s what makes you versatile. That’s what makes you a problem-solver. Start asking “why” and work your way from the <L href="https://youtu.be/SLFN-XfeYXw?si=0IDKskPOzAsI6EIe">bottom</L> up, not the other way around. Build abstractions yourself, not just rely on them.
</C>

<C>
Be an engineer, not a <L href="https://johndanielraines.medium.com/be-an-engineer-not-a-frameworker-c58fe28d0c88">frameworker</L>. Think like one.
</C>

<H2>I Get It, But What Should I Learn?</H2>

<C>
There’s no single <L href="https://roadmap.sh">roadmap</L>. The field is vast. If I give you a step-by-step plan, you’ll likely get overwhelmed or focus on the wrong things. Everything I mention will sound foreign if you’re not already familiar with it. So here’s a better idea:
</C>

<C>
Pick something, anything that interests you. Complex or simple, doesn’t matter. Then start asking, “Why does this exist? What problem is it solving?” Follow the trail. Dig deep. Keep going until you’ve uncovered the entire system. It’s a <L href="https://youtu.be/zE7PKRjrid4?si=24T8DoioD-7WotOC&t=93">rabbit hole</L>, but when you emerge, you’ll be miles ahead of the average “developer” who’s just memorized tutorials.
</C>

<H2>The Backwards Education System</H2>

<C>
The education system we’ve got out here prioritizes breadth over depth. It teaches you just enough to be dangerous but not enough to be effective. It’s about familiarity with tools, not mastery of principles. Why? Because tools sell courses. Principles don’t.
</C>

<C>
Instead of focusing on fleeting trends, dive deep into how things actually work. Question abstractions. Isn’t that what <L href="/blog/shitty-colleges">colleges</L> are supposed to teach you? As you progress, you’ll start questioning what you’ve learned, forming your own insights, and developing real mastery.
