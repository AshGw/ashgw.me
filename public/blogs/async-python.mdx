<C>
You may have encountered explanations that appear overly simplistic, merely emphasizing the importance of async programming without delving into the mechanics or exploring high-level APIs such as the <L href="https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/main/Lib/asyncio">`asyncio`</L> module in the standard library. Clearly, you already understand the significance and use cases, so let's cut to the chase and see how it actually works.
</C>
<H2>Pausing Execution</H2>
<C>
So, what's the deal with async functions in Python? The common refrain is about them not blocking execution until some operation resolves right? but how does this mechanism truly operate? To understand this, let's take a step back and delve into the foundational concept:
</C>
<H2>Iterators</H2>
<C>
An iterator serves as a programming object that facilitates the systematic traversal of a <L href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_(abstract_data_type)">container</L>, granting access to its elements one at a time. It maintains the state of the traversal, allowing the iterator to pause execution after processing a specific item. To continue, a call to the `next()` method, typically named by convention, is made. This call prompts the iterator to resume execution and retrieve the next element in the sequence. This iterative process persists until the iterator reaches the end of the container, and this approach is commonly referred to as lazy evaluation.
</C>
<S3/>
<C>
The key concepts here are the actions of pausing, resuming, and awaiting the next element. These notions become particularly relevant and meaningful when correlated with the concept of asynchronous functions. In the context of async functions, the idea of pausing and resuming execution aligns with the asynchronous nature of handling tasks, allowing the program to efficiently manage and switch between various operations without blocking the entire execution flow. The term "await" further emphasizes this waiting aspect, where the program can await the completion of a specific asynchronous task before proceeding, we call this task a <L href="#related-objects">``Future``</L> , echoing the behavior of iterators in a more dynamic and non-blocking context.
</C>
<H2>How Do I Make An Iterator</H2>
<C>
To define your own iterator you have to adhere to the iterator <L href='/blog/python-protocols'>protocol</L> meaning you have to define `__iter__` and `__next__` methods
</C>
<H3>**``__iter__``**</H3>
<C>
 The purpose of the ``__iter__`` method is to return the iterator object itself. When this method is implemented in a class, it allows instances of that class to be used in a ``for`` loop or any other iteration context. By returning the iterator object, it enables the iteration over the elements of the associated object.
 </C>
 <H3>**``__next__``**</H3>
<C>
 The ``__next__`` method is here to provide the next element in the sequence when iterating over the associated object. For example, in a loop like `for x in my_object`, Python internally calls `my_object.__next__()` in each iteration to fetch the subsequent element. If the iteration is complete, the method raises a `StopIteration` error, signaling that there are no more elements to be retrieved.
</C>
 <H2>Example</H2>
<C>
This object enables you to read a file, line by line without loading the entire file into memory.
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`class EfficientFile:
    def __init__(self, file_path: str):
        self.file_path = file_path

    def __iter__(self) -> 'EfficientFile':
        self.file = open(self.file_path, 'r')
        return self

    def __next__(self) -> str:
        line = self.file.readline()
        if not line:
            self.file.close()
            raise StopIteration
        return line.strip()

file = EfficientFile(file_path='pyproject.toml')

for line in file:
    print(line)
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={true}
/>
<C>An alternative way to read all the lines using the `next()` method:</C>
<Code
  code=
{`try: 
	while True:
		line = next(file) # or file.__next__()
		print(line) 
except StopIteration:
	pass
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>In this example, the `__iter__` method <L href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open">opens</L> the file, and the `__next__` method reads one line at a time until the end of the file is reached. This approach ensures that only one line is loaded into memory at a time, by only loading parts of the file upon request, the request in this case is the act of calling the `next()` method which makes it memory-efficient, even for large files.</C>
<H2>Async Iterators</H2>
<C>
The extend the concept of iterators to asynchronous operations. Async iterators implement two key methods:
</C>
<H3>**``__aiter__``**</H3>
<C>
 Similar to its synchronous counterpart, this method returns the async iterator object itself, making it compatible with `async for` loops instead of traditional `for` loops.
  </C>
 <H3>**``__anext__``**</H3>
<C>
Is the async version of `next`, `__anext__` provides the next asynchronous value only upon request. This is contingent on the completion of another [Future]() object. When the async iterator exhausts its items, it triggers a `StopAsyncIteration` exception. The implementation of this method should return a `Future` of some sort.
</C>
<C>
The invocation of `__anext__` involves the use of the `async` and `await` keywords. Speaking of which, the `await` keyword can only be used with an ``awaitable`` object. So...
</C>
<H2>What Exactly Is An **``awaitable``**</H2>
<C>
An ``awaitable`` is an object that can be used with the `await` keyword within an async function. It typically represents an operation that may not be immediately completed, such as an asynchronous task or a `Future` object. Essentially, an awaitable is anything that can be awaited for its completion, allowing the program to proceed with other tasks while waiting for the awaited operation to finish.
</C>
<H2>How Do I Define An **``awaitable``**</H2>
<C>
Define an object that implements the `__await__()` dunder method which should  return a generator object
</C>
<H2>What Are Generators ?</H2>
<C>
Generators are functions that leverage the `yield` keyword. Their primary purpose is to provide a concise and efficient means of creating iterators. The inclusion of `yield` within generator functions eliminates the need for manual implementation of the iterator protocol.
</C>
<S3/>
<C>
When encountering the '`yield`' statement, an event occurs: The current state of the generator function is preserved, and control is temporarily relinquished back to the calling function or context. At this point, the generator is in a suspended state, storing all local variables and the execution point.
</C>
<S3/>
<C>
Upon calling the generator again, whether through a `for` loop or the `next()` function, the generator resumes execution from where it was paused by the last '`yield`'. This resumption allows the generator to produce the next value in the sequence. This process repeats until the generator function completes or encounters a '`return`' statement.
</C>
<S3/>
<C>
Now, this behavior is also associated with coroutines, a `Coroutine` is essentially  an `awaitable` object designed to handle asynchronous operations. A `Coroutine` accepts three types: the yield type, the send type, and the return type, just like the generator below.
</C>
<Code
  code=
{`def my_generator() -> Generator[YieldType, None, None]:
    yield some_value
    yield another_value


gen = my_generator()
for value in gen:
    print(value)
`}
language="python"
showLineNumbers={false}
/>
<C>
  - \- The first `None` represents the type of the value that can be sent into the generator using the `send()` method (though this is optional and not commonly used).
  - \- The second `None` represents the type of the value that the generator returns. In most cases, generators don't return a value explicitly, so it's `None`.
  - \- If the generator doesn't yield any values, you can replace `YieldType` with `None` 
</C>
<H2 id="related-objects">Related Objects</H2>
<C>
I've referred to `Future`, so what's a future ? it's a combination of both `iterable` and `awaitable` , you might have also encountered an `asynciterable`, this is an object that defines and `aiter` method and returns an `asynciterator`. Lastly there's `AsyncGenerator`, just like `Generator` but it actually it inherits from an ``AsyncIterator`` instead of `Ìterator` 
</C>

Seems confusing doesn't it ?
