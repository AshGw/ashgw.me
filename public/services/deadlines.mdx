A deadline signifies more than just a point in time when work should be completed. It indicates that the project must be operational in a real-world production environment by that date **without** sacrificing <L href="/blog/quality">quality.</L> Simply regarding it as the moment to submit source code is shortsighted and ultimately dissatisfying for the client.

<H2>In Case We Come Short</H2>
<C>
Additional time is always allocated for addressing unexpected challenges, but, when time is extra tight one must know where this extra time comes from: 
<S3/>
- \- Sacrifice code quality.
- \- Outsource work or <L href="/services/glossary#team">hire</L> more engineers.
- \- Drop low-priority features.
</C>
<C>
Sacrificing quality is a short-term fix, it will inevitably lead to issues later on. Most software teams that opt for this approach end up with unmaintainable code, resulting in numerous bugs, performance issues, or even requiring a complete project rewrite. In my projects, I never consider this as an option. 
Speaking of code quality, ensuring that your team maintains high standards may require periodic <L href="/blog/independent-code-audit">independent code audits</L> which I <L href="/services/code-audits">offer.</L> 
</C>
<C>
Outsourcing work is a viable solution, but it comes with additional costs. Therefore, it's only considered when it provides a positive ROI
</C>
<C>
The latter option maximizes utility and minimizes losses the most, which in this case, is the optimal play. Before one drops features, they must already be: 
</C>
<H3 id="prioritized">Prioritized</H3>
<C>
Requirements are categorized using the <L href="">**`MoSCoW`**</L> method, where they're broken down into four priority levels: **``Must``**, **``Should``**, **``Could``**, and **``Won't``**, where **``Must-have``** features are non-negotiable, **``Should``** features are important but may be subject to evaluation, and **``Could``** features are considered based on time constraints. So dropping features is an simple two step process:
<S2/>
- \- The feature's priority must not be classified as **``Must``**.
- \- Client approval must be obtained before dropping the feature.
</C>
<C>
Once these criteria are met, the feature can be safely removed.
</C>
<C>
If the client still desires a dropped feature, it can be revisited after the deadline has been met and the product is operational. This additional feature could even serve as a supplementary marketing asset, further promoting the project's success.

Sometimes it may be realized that certain features were unnecessary altogether, this will allow resources to be reallocated to more critical tasks.
