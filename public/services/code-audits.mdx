In short, I talked about how independent audits can help mitigate issues stemming from a lack of oversight within internal teams (for many <L href="/blog/tag/skill-issues">reasons</L>). 
Without vigilant scrutiny of <L href="/blog/tag/quality">quality</L> and architectural integrity, problems can escalate unnoticed, hindering future development, which leads to project failures and loss of money.

Audits come in two forms, business and technical. For business, it's designed for business owners seeking clarity on their project's status. It provides a concise one-page review covering crucial aspects such as suitability for future modifications, flexibility in team adjustments and code quality assessment. And for technical teams  it aids in uncovering as many <L href="/services/glossary#tickets">bugs</L> as possible.  All within a fixed one-day service.
