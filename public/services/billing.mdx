<C>
I invoice my clients solely for <L href="/services/glossary#tasks">tasks</L> that have been successfully completed.
</C>

<C>
No completed tasks = no pay.
</C>
<H2>Cycle</H2>


<C>
My billing cycle operates on a weekly basis, where I include charges for closed tasks from the preceding week.
</C>



<C>
In the event that a client fails to remit payment within the agreed-upon timeframe, I pause all ongoing development activities for that client until payment is received.

<H2 id="task-cost">
Task Cost
</H2>


<C>
Since each task comes with a predefined estimate, typically ranging from five minutes to an hour, which remains fixed, I personally have an hourly rate set at **$30**. In the event of full-scale <L href="/services/full-software-solution">project development</L>, it often involves more than just myself. Therefore, each <L href="/service/glossary#team">team</L> member has their own hourly rate, which will be <L href="/services/communication">communicated</L> to you.
</C>

<C>
The cost for each task is determined by the following formula:
</C>


<C>
task_cost = task_estimated_hours * hourly_rate

Payment Methods
</H2>

**PayPal, Bank Transfers, USD-T.**
