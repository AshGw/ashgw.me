We do not communicate through messaging apps, emails, phone calls, and face-to-face meetings. These channels are challenging to track, and always lead to information leakage.
 </C>
 <C>
Simply because traditional communication channels can be challenging to track effectively. Conversations may span across multiple platforms and become fragmented, making it difficult to keep a comprehensive record of discussions and decisions made throughout the project lifecycle. This fragmentation can lead to information leakage, where important details or updates may be missed or overlooked.
</C>
<C>
Instead, all communication is centralized through the <L href="/services/glossary#ticket-system">ticket system</L>, where each communication thread is tied to a specific subject or <L href="/services/glossary#tasks">task</L> related to the project. This ensures that discussions remain focused and relevant, streamlining communication and making it easier to track progress on individual tasks or topics.

Aside from the traceability provided by the ticket system, <L href="/services/transparency">transparency</L> is crucial. It grants stakeholders real-time visibility into project updates, milestones, and potential roadblocks, where they can actively monitor the project's progression from initiation to completion, which helps to build trust and confidence among all parties involved.

So by centralizing communication through the ticket system, we ensure that all interactions adhere to established guidelines and protocols. This helps mitigate the risk of misunderstandings, conflicts, or misinterpretations, particularly as the project expands in complexity or involves multiple stakeholders.
